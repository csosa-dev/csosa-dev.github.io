<p style="display:none">What are you even trying to play? are you using this for gaming or simulating hurricane wind pattern predictions for NEMO? Whatever its use, this is the EIHWAZ Ultra Gaming PC. It's equipped with the AMD RYZEN 7 5800X processor and kept cooler than a Belikin Stout in Caye Caulker using the MSI MAG CORELIQUID M240. Tell your friends you solely play minecraft with the MSI GeForce RTX 4060 Ti GAMING X 16G - it pumps out more FPS than your little 60Hz monitor can handle. 1TB SSD has enough space to store your extensive collection of downloaded memes and still have room for your games, unless you install COD Warzone... We dont Judge! This PC packs 32GB of DDR4 RAM, now you can have a whopping 162 tabs open in your web browser. Who closes tabs anyways.</p>
